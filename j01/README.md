Keurig Coffee makers, in general, tend to do some things extremely well and will be lackluster in other areas. For example, the buttons on the second picture have different icons corresponding to the different amounts of coffee the machine can make. The icons give you a general idea of how much you are getting, but it's a little vague. It would be nice if they added some numbers right next to the different buttons that say how much coffee it will make in ounces. The other two buttons are the strong button and the power button. The power button has three little LEDs that light up when you turn the machine on. The strong button is where things get a little more hard to understand. It's hard to know exactly what the strong button does without reading the manual or knowing what strong coffee is. By clicking the strong button it will light up and show that it's on. It will make the coffee have a stronger and bolder taste. In general, these buttons are very **learnable** and **memorable**. One thing I especially like about the Keurig Coffee maker is how **effective** and **efficient** it is. Coffee is made within a matter of minutes from when you turn the machine on.
