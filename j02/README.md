I moved into my new apartment at the start of this semester and I have never encountered a remote control AC unit. I had to learn how to use it for the first time. There are some obvious things about the remote, like the On/Off button being yellow to emphasize how important it is, and the arrow keys that make the temperature hotter or colder, but most of the design of the remote is hard to understand. There are a ton of buttons that I had no clue what they did without having to look up a manual. Even after reading the manual there were still some buttons I didn’t understand, so I watched a YouTube video to figure out exactly what they did. I’d say overall, the Daikin remote was horrible at being **learnable**, but now that I know the buttons, it is actually extremely **memorable**.
